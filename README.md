# GameOn | Game-a-thon signup

## Description

GameOn is a website, where people interested in gaming are able to sign up and reserve tickets for a game-a-thon.

Aim of the project was to **finish the existing layout** and content for the landing page and the modal form. In addition to that, the **form validation** needed to be set up, as well as error messaging and a confirmation message.

## Objectives

### LAYOUT

- finalized markup and styling for the landing page
- finalized modal markup
- finalized form markup, including linking labels to input fields
- improved responsiveness (amongst others for navigation, font sizes and background image)
- positioning of the navigation in mobile view

### FUNCTIONALITY

The website content can be divided into **three parts**.

1. Added functionality to **close/x icon** on modal to close modal
1. Added functionality to form inputs
1. Added form **validation** on submit (**client-side** and **constraint** validation)
   - first name field has nim of 2 characters / is not empty
   - last name field has min of 2 characters / is not empty
   - email is valid
   - for numbers of competitions, number value is entered
   - one radio button is selected
   - terms and conditions checkbox is checked, the other checkbox is optional / can be left unchecked
   - form inputs are retained (i.e. not cleared), when form does not pass validation
1. Added **error messaging**
   - specific error messages appear under input that is not correct. Error messages display below associated nput field.
1. Added **confirmation message** of successful submission
   - After successful validation, confirmation message is included and replaces the form in the modal (functionality of submit button is changed to closing the modal)
1. Manual **testing**
